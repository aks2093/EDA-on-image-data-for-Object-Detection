"# EDA-on-image-data-for-Object-Detection" 

Data Source: http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/sfzhang/WiderPerson/
This notebook contails below deatils
1. plotting bounding boxes on the images using text files mentioned in the Data Source
2. Find number of classes and their names in the dataset.
3. Find number of images per class and plot a graph.
4. Find number of annotations per class and plot a graph.
5. Plot a line graph for height and width of the images.
6. Find number of annotations per image
7. Plot montage for a small partition of dataset
8. The dataset contains images with different resolutions resize them into same resolution such that their annotations are preserved ?
9. suggest methods to handle imbalance in class distribution with respect to the above dataset ? 
10. Performance Metrics to monitor the object detection training.
