"# EDA-on-image-data-for-Object-Detection" 

Data Source: http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/sfzhang/WiderPerson/



This notebook contails below deatils
1. plotting bounding boxes on the images using text files mentioned in the Data Source
2. Number of classes and their names in the dataset.
3. Number of images per class and plot a graph.
4. Number of annotations per class and plot a graph.
5. Plot a line graph for height and width of the images.
6. Number of annotations per image
7. Plot montage for a small partition of dataset
8. The dataset contains images with different resolutions resize them into same resolution such that their annotations are preserved
9. Methods to handle imbalance in class distribution with respect to the above dataset
10. Performance Metrics to monitor the object detection training.
